**🛠 Developing**

Navigate into the lt3-static-site directory and start it up.

```shell
cd lt3-static-site
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: \_`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.

```shell
gatsby build
```

You can see a production like instance of the running docs site by running:
